The main changes I made were in regard to the style of the pages.
I did not like the look of the scroll wheel on pages when it was not necessary, so I updated the grid areas to fit the screen better and eliminate unneeded scrolling. 
I also fixed the style of the navigation bar to have a fixed width, ensuring consistency across all pages. 
Additionally, I resolved several validation errors related to color, color-mix, and incorrect label usage for the email input, making sure the code meets web standards. 
I removed unused JavaScript files and the experiments.html file to keep the repository clean and efficient. 
Lastly, I adjusted the padding on the theme-toggle button for visual cohesion across all pages.
