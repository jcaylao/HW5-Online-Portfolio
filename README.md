# HW5-Online-Portfolio
The main changes I made were the styles of most/all of my pages. 
I did not like the look of the scroll wheel on pages when it was not necessary on some of the pages, so I updated the styling the grid areas to fit the screens better. 
I also fixed the style of the navigation bar to have a fixed width because the width would be different between each page.
